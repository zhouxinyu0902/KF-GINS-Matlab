## An EKF-based GNSS/INS Integrated Navigation Systems in Matlab (Matlab Version of KF-GINS)

### Introduction

As a classic loosely coupled GNSS/INS integrated navigation algorithm, [KF-GINS](https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/KF-GINS) is suitable for beginners to learn and understand integrated navigation. However, the C++ implementation of KF-GINS still makes debugging, modification, and extension challenging for newcomers. Therefore, we open-source a Matlab-based integrated navigation software, KF-GINS-Matlab, which serves as the Matlab version of KF-GINS. This version is more suited for teaching, experiments, and beginners. In addition to replicating KF-GINS in Matlab, KF-GINS-Matlab incorporates a GNSS velocity update algorithm and a framework for ODO/NHC updates (Note: the ODO/NHC measurement update is not fully implemented, and ODO scale factor error is not augmented. You are encouraged to complete the algorithms based on the documentation as a learning exercise).

## 2. Run KF-GINS-Matlab

### 2.1 Environment and Download KF-GINS-Matlab

KF-GINS-Matlab runs in Matlab without additional dependencies, requiring no specific system environment or Matlab version.

To download, use the following git command or download the zip package from GitHub and extract it.

```
git clone https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/KF-GINS-Matlab.git ~/
```

### 2.2  Run KF-GINS-Matlab

1）Open the KF-GINS-Matlab folder in Matlab.[[中]](./README_CN.md) &ensp; [[EN]](./README.md)

2）Double-click the `kf-gins.m` file to open it in the editor. Click "Run" in the editor or type `kf-gins` in the command window (default: `ProcessConfig1.m`).

3）Wait for the program to finish running.

### 2.3 Display Results

1）Add the `plot-function` folder to the workspace: right-click the folder and select "Add to Path" -> "Selected Folders and Subfolders."

2）Expand the `plot-function` folder, and execute `plot_result.m` to plot navigation results or `calc_error.m` to plot positioning errors.

### 2.4 Notes

For the ODO/NHC update framework, set the ODO update time according to the preset update frequency. At each update, use the `GetOdoVel` function to obtain ODO velocities from raw data.

In `GetOdoVel.m`, average ODO data from 10 epochs before and after the update time to reduce quantization noise.

### 2.5 Run Other Test Data

1）Modify the `cfg` value in `kf-gins.m` to run other test datasets. Update file paths in plotting scripts as needed.

2）For custom test data, define a new `ProcessConfig.m` file and modify file paths and configurations accordingly.

## 3 Test Data
